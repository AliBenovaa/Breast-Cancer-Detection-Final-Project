# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Final-Project
The final project of breast cancer detection with a basic CNN model and three different transfer learning architectures for the course "Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with Tensorflow", University of Osnabrueck Wi/Se 2022/23

As a team of three women, we have chosen to focus on breast cancer detection because we believe it is a crucial and compelling topic. Our motivation behind this project is to explore techniques for analyzing mammograms that can accurately detect and prevent late or unnecessary treatments. We will do this by exploring different architectures, like the ResNet50, VGG16 and InceptionV3, used with a transfer learning method. These models are compared with each other and a basic convolutional neural network. 

This is our implemented code.

How to understand the coding system: 

The "IANN_BCP_Code" folder holds all the final and correct codes mentioned in our project report. The images used in the report that are not displayed in the codes are placed in the "IMAGES" folder. 
The other documents in this folder are pre-optimised codes that are not guaranteed to be fully functional. However, we wanted to display them to give you the possibility of seeing our progress throughout the project. 

All the best, 

Alexandra Benova, Christina Gollub and Lisa Mesch
